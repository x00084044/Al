A smart device unit test is just a unit test created in a smart device test project.

 There are two ways to create unit tests in a smart device project. You can generate them from your production code, as described in the following procedure, and then edit them to work the way you want. Or, you can write unit tests by hand.
 
Creating unit test.

                                There are two phases to creating a unit test.
                                
1. The first phase is generating a unit test file that contains a skeleton version of a test method for each method in the code that you are testing. Each skeleton test method is generated with empty variables and a placeholder Assert statement.

2. The second phase is initializing the variables and replacing the placeholder Assert statement with an appropriate one.

Every program like "InteliJ Idea" or "Windows Visual Studio" has it own testing techneeck.

                               How to: Create a Unit Test without Source Code.
Visual Studio 2008
You can create a unit test for an .EXE or .DLL for which you do not have access to the source code.
As with other unit tests, there are two phases to creating a unit test for a compiled .EXE or .DLL.
   The first phase is generating a unit test file that contains a skeleton version of a test method for each method in the code that you are testing.
   Each skeleton test method is generated with empty variables and a placeholder Assert statement.
The second phase is initializing the variables and replacing the placeholder Assert statement with an appropriate one.
After you have created your unit test, you can run it any time.
